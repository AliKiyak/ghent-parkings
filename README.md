## Workflow
The application is completely built using functional components. To manage the state of the application, I've chosen to make use of the React Context API and Hooks. 
The initialisation of the ContextProvider can be found here. 

## Available Scripts

To be able to get an overview of ghent-parkings, you can use:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
